age-of-python:develop
=====================

This is the develop branch.

If you want to work on a new feature, create a new branch for it with for example: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`

Or if a branch for something exists and you want to switch to it `git checkout existing-branch`

To push to a branch you're on, first check it out, then `git push origin my-branch`

To pull changes from a branch, do: `git fetch origin the-branch-name`, then `git merge origin/the-branch-name`.

Send me a pull request if you have cool changes you pushed.
