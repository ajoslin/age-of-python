=====================

This is the develop branch.

If you want to work on a new feature, first switch to the develop branch: `git checkout develop`. Then create a new branch for your feature: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`.  Checking out a new branch while on the develop branch will create your new branch as a child of `develop`.

Or if a branch for something exists and you want to switch to it `git checkout existing-branch`

To push a branch you're on, do `git push origin my-branch`

To pull changes from a branch, do: `git fetch origin the-branch-name`, then `git merge origin/the-branch-name`.

Send me a pull request if you have cool changes you pushed.
